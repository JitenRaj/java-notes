## Design Patterns

Design pattern are reusable, proven solutions to common problems that occur during software design.

They are not finished pieces of code that can be transformed directly into a program; rather, they are templates or best practices that describe how to solve a problem in a way that is efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

Think of them as **blueprints** for solving recurring architectural challenges, allowing developers to communicate using a shared vocabulary and avoid "reinventing the wheel."

### The 3 Types of Design Patterns

- **[Creational Design Patterns](./creational-design-patterns/creational-design-patterns.md)**

    These patterns deal with **object creation mechanisms**.

- **[Structural Design Patterns](./structural-design-patterns/structural-design-patterns.md)**

    These patterns focus on **how classes and objects are composed** to form larger structures.

- **[Behavioral Design Patterns](./behavioral-design-patterns/behavioral-design-patterns.md)**

    These patterns are specifically concerned with **communication between objects**.
