## Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are blueprints for how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. They focus on composition (how objects are connected) and relationships (how they interact).

The primary goal is to ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure doesn't need to be rebuilt. They help in ensuring that independent parts of the system can work together seamlessly.

### Quick Comparison Table

| Pattern | Core Concept | Key Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Adapter | Wrapping incompatible interfaces | Interoperability between legacy/new code. |
| Bridge | Separating Abstraction & Implementation | Independent evolution of classes. |
| Composite | Tree structures | Uniform treatment of parts and wholes. |
| Decorator | Dynamic wrappers | Flexible behavior extension without inheritance. |
| Facade | Simplified entry point | Reduces complexity and dependency. |
| Flyweight | Object sharing | Reduces memory usage for large numbers of objects. |
| Proxy | Access control | Adds security, lazy loading, or logging. |
